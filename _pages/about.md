I am a medical doctor with the [Ministry of Health, Malaysia](https://www.moh.gov.my/) and an otorhinolaryngology-head & neck surgery (ORL-HNS) resident at the Master of Medicine (ORL-HNS) program of [Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (ORL-HNS)](https://medic.usm.my/home-orlhns.html), [School of Medical Sciences](https://medic.usm.my/), [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my/), Kelantan, Malaysia. 

My current research focuses on the application of large language models in healthcare and head and neck cancers. I am also interested in understanding the cellular and molecular basis of cancer metabolism and microenvironment. 

I read [pre-clinical medicine](https://www.biology.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/MedST/Current/Course/Years1and2) and [Part II Natural Sciences (Pharmacology)](https://www.phar.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/bbs) at [Christ's College](https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://wwww.cam.ac.uk) before completing my undergraduate medical training at [Barts & The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/fmd/). During my clinical studies at Barts & The London, I completed a PhD degree in Oncology at [Hughes Hall](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Professor John R. Griffiths](https://crukcambridgecentre.org.uk/users/griffiths) at the [Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute](https://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk) as a visiting MB-PhD student at the [Cambridge MB-PhD](https://www.medschl.cam.ac.uk/clinical-school-mbphd-course-information) program.
