I am a medical doctor with the [Ministry of Health, Malaysia](https://www.moh.gov.my/) and an otorhinolaryngology-head & neck surgery (ORL-HNS) resident at the Master of Medicine (ORL-HNS) program of the [Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (ORL-HNS)](https://medic.usm.my/home-orlhns.html), [School of Medical Sciences](https://medic.usm.my/), [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my/). 

# <b>Research Interests</b>  

My current research focuses on using <b>large language models</b> to study <b>head and neck cancer treatment response.</b>  

I am also interested in using <b>foundation models</b> to study <b>single cell</b> and <b>spatial biology</b>, as well as understanding the cellular and molecular basis of <b>cancer metabolism</b> and the <b>tumour microenvironment</b>.

My research experience encompasses the spectrum of basic science, translational, and clinical research.  

A list of my publications is available [here](https://shenhanlee.github.io/publications).

# <b>Background</b>  

I studied [pre-clinical medicine](https://www.biology.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/MedST/Current/Course/Years1and2) and [natural sciences (pharmacology)](https://www.phar.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/bbs) as an undergraduate at [Christ's College](https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), before completing my clinical studies at [Barts & The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/fmd/).  

During my clinical studies, I was awarded a Cancer Research UK (CRUK) PhD Studentship to undertake a PhD in Oncology at the [Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute](https://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk) and [Hughes Hall](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Professor John R. Griffiths](https://crukcambridgecentre.org.uk/users/griffiths). In collaboration with [Professor Adrian L. Harris](https://www.oncology.ox.ac.uk/team/adrian-harris), [Professor Pawel Swietach](https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/pawel-swietach) and [Professor Sebastián Cerdán](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jnc.15828), my PhD research focused on using <i>in vivo</i> pH imaging with <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to study the function of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), an enzyme overexpressed in hypoxic tumours. We identified a [new function of CAIX](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-018-0216-5) that cancer cells use to control their extracellular acidity, opening up the possibility of targeting this enzyme to disrupt cancer metabolism. 

Throughout my PhD studies, I was also a visiting MB-PhD student at the [Cambridge MB-PhD](https://www.medschl.cam.ac.uk/clinical-school-mbphd-course-information) program, giving me the opportunity to combine medical training with doctoral research.
