![St John Chapel Cambridge](images/St John Chapel Cambridge.jpg){: .align-right width="496px"}  

I am a medical doctor with the [Ministry of Health, Malaysia](https://www.moh.gov.my/) and an otorhinolaryngology-head & neck surgery (ORL-HNS) resident at the Master of Medicine (ORL-HNS) program of the [Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (ORL-HNS)](https://medic.usm.my/home-orlhns.html), [School of Medical Sciences](https://medic.usm.my/), [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my/). 

# <b>Research Interests</b>  

My current research focuses on the application of natural language processing using <b>large language models</b> in healthcare and head and neck cancer research. I am also interested in understanding the cellular and molecular basis of <b>cancer metabolism</b> and the <b>tumour microenvironment</b>. I have an extensive research experience that encompasses basic science as well as translational and clinical studies. A list of my publications is available [here](https://shenhanlee.github.io/publications).

# <b>My Background</b>  

I studied [pre-clinical medicine](https://www.biology.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/MedST/Current/Course/Years1and2) and [natural sciences (pharmacology)](https://www.phar.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/bbs) as an undergraduate at [Christ's College](https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), before completing my clinical studies at [Barts & The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/fmd/). During my clinical studies, I was awarded a Cancer Research UK (CRUK) PhD Studentship to undertake a PhD in Oncology at the [Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute](https://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk) and [Hughes Hall](https://www.hughes.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Professor John R. Griffiths](https://crukcambridgecentre.org.uk/users/griffiths). This work focused on using <i>in vivo</i> pH imaging with <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to study the function of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), an enzyme overexpressed in hypoxic tumours. During my PhD studies, I was also a visiting MB-PhD student at the [Cambridge MB-PhD](https://www.medschl.cam.ac.uk/clinical-school-mbphd-course-information) program.
