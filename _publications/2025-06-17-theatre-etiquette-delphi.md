**Introduction:** The importance of non-technical skills (NTS) to surgical performance and patient safety has been increasingly recognised by surgical teams. Inductions for new surgical team members in theatre often provide insufficient, non-standard and 'ad hoc' training in theatre behaviour and etiquette. We conducted a Delphi consensus study among senior surgeons to develop standardised guidance on theatre etiquette for those unfamiliar with the theatre environment, including resident surgical trainees and medical students.

**Methods:** An international Delphi process of two rounds was conducted. An electronic survey was distributed among senior surgeons, anaesthetists and senior scrub nurses/practitioners, with participants recruited via surgical societies. Participants were asked to rank each statement on a Likert scale of 1 to 5. Consensus was considered if achieved for any statement for which 75% or more indicated agreement. The study was registered with the Open Science Framework.

**Results:** A total of 261 participants completed the Delphi process; 239 valid responses were included in round 1, with a 23% dropout in round 2. Participants were from 23 countries, 66% were from the UK, 58.2% were male, 51% were from the 30 to 40-year age group, 39% were consultant surgeons and 49% were senior trainees. General surgeons made up 68.6% of respondents, trauma and orthopaedic surgeons 13.4%, healthcare practitioners 2.1% and anaesthetists 1.3%. Thirteen statements were excluded, and 29 reached agreement and were included in the final guidance.

**Conclusion:** There was agreement among a large international group of surgeons to develop a standardised guidance for theatre etiquette, addressing most of the key aspects of professional conduct and team dynamics. We anticipate that this guidance will serve as a valuable resource for orienting new members of the surgical team, providing a clear framework for maintaining professionalism and fostering effective communication within the theatre environment.
