In this paper, we report the design and development of a metamaterial (MTM)-based directional coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed reconfigurable textile antenna using radiofrequency (RF) varactor diodes for microwave breast imaging. Both simulation and measurement results of the proposed MTM-based CPW-fed reconfigurable textile antenna revealed a continuous frequency reconfiguration to a distinct frequency band between 2.42 GHz and 3.2 GHz with a frequency ratio of 2.33:1, and with a static bandwidth at 4-15 GHz. The results also indicated that directional radiation pattern could be produced at the frequency reconfigurable region and the antenna had a peak gain of 7.56 dBi with an average efficiency of more than 67%. The MTM-based reconfigurable antenna was also tested under the deformed condition and analysed in the vicinity of the breast phantom. This microwave imaging system was used to perform simulation and measurement experiments on a custom-fabricated realistic breast phantom with heterogeneous tissue composition with image reconstruction using delay-and-sum (DAS) and delay-multiply-and-sum (DMAS) algorithms. Given that the MWI system was capable of detecting a cancer as small as 10 mm in the breast phantom, we propose that this technique may be used clinically for the detection of breast cancer.
